**Project Specification:**

Teams will design and implement a web-based university course management system. 
The system will make use of the university database that you have been working on since the beginning of this semester. 
The system will utilize the Django web framework to connect to MySQL and to hold together all components: 
                  loading data from database and dynamically creating a web page for displaying the data. 
The user interface will be built using Django templates.

Your system will provide functionalities for three kinds of users: admin, prof, and students, as follows:

Admin can do the following: 
F1. Create a list of professors sorted by one of the following criteria chosen by the admin: (1) by name (2) by dept, or (3) by salary
F2. Create a table of min/max/average salaries by dept
F3. Create a table of professor name, dept, and total number of students taught by the professor in a given semester
Professors can do the following:
F4. Create the list of course sections and the number of students enrolled in each section that the professor taught in a given semester
F5. Create the list of students enrolled in a course section taught by the professor in a given semester
Students can do the following:
F6. Query the list of course sections offered by dept in a given semester and year.
